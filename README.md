# Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis

## Project Overview
We helped Roza create a customized dashboard for her Belly Button Biodiversity study. The dashboard provides demographic information as well as visualizations of the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Summary

The following deliverables include:

1. Create a Horizontal Bar Chart that displays the top 10 bacterial species (OUTs) by sample_values of a selected test subject ID

2. Create a Bubble Chart that will display the following of a selected test subject ID:
    - The otu_ids as the x-axis values
    - The sample_values as the y-axis values
    - The sample_values as the marker size
    - The otu_ids as the marker colors
    - The otu_labels as the hover-text values

3. Create a Gauge Chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar for a selected test subject ID

4. Customize the Dashboard: 
    - Added an transparent image to the jumbotron
    - Added light pale green to the webpage
    - Used a custom font with contrast for the colors
